This is a basic home automation project with the help of which you can control your home appliances from any part of the world with the help of iot.
The hardware and online services used in the project are as follows-

(1)IFTTT(If this then that) platform.
(2)Blynk iot app.
(3)NodeMCU with stable internet connection.
(4)Jumper Wires and led.

With the help of Blynk app we can control the nodeMCU from any part of the world by uploading proper code into nodeMCU.
For syncing google assistant with blynk app I have used a very helpful online platform called IFTTT with the help of which we can connect two applications to each other so that they can work together and do what a single application could'nt do on it's own.
